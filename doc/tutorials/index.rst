Tutorials
=========

This section contains a series of tutorials that guide users through features and applications of the HANS framework. 
Each tutorial is designed to provide hands-on experience with different aspects, going from basic concepts to 
simulations that integrate all previously covered parts.

The first tutorial introduces the mathematical foundation for the multiscale approach, splitting the problem into a micro- and 
macro-problem. Subsequent tutorials build upon this foundation, covering the constitutive equations for stress, equations of state,
and viscosity. The pieces are brought together in tutorials 5 and 6, which focus on confined fluids and lubrication problems.
Tutorial 7 introduces Gaussian Processes for surrogate modeling of the micro-problem with Molecular Dynamics, 
and the final tutorial introduces elastic deformation of the solid surfaces.
